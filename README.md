# Falcon
Falcon is your department's dream. Built specifically for Emergency Response: Liberty County, it offers a robust amount of services to benefit your ER:LC department. It features systems such as promotions/demotions, infractions, ERC (Employee Record Cards), and it's main feature: an extensive staff database, all accessible within a few commands. Whether you're a 50 member department in a small server, or a 1,500 member department in the largest of servers, the bot is built and structured for you.

## About Us
Falcon is owned and developed by TASG, a TypeScript & JavaScript developer who has been coding since the age of 8, and playing ER:LC since 11. He has developed for servers such as Federate (4,600 members), Florida State Roleplay (2,500 members), Washington State Roleplay (5,200 members), and more. He has also worked at places such as Central (24,000 servers).

Falcon's main goal is to bridge the gap between main + department servers, and to make it simple for anyone to get a department up and running as quick as they can.
